Aviation_Performance 
> This script is using Selenium, a tool for automating web browsers, to scrape data from a website. It uses the Chrome browser and the chromedriver.exe file to open the website, enters login credentials, sets a date range, and then loops through a function that downloads data in the form of an excel file. The script also uses other libraries such as pandas, datetime, and mariadb for data manipulation and storage.
